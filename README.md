DS1807 Digital Potentiometer Library
===============

This is an Arduino library for interfacing to Dallas Semiconductor's DS1807, 64-level, dual digital potentiometer (variable resistor).

The DS1807 communicates over the I2C bus.  This library uses the Arduino Wire.h library for that communication.

## Status

Partially tested, but read-back has errors.
